I have created a gesture control ping pong game 
Hand Tracking Ping Pong
This is a hand-controlled ping pong game that uses OpenCV and MediaPipe for hand tracking and Pygame for game rendering.
Features
Hand Gesture Control: Move paddles using hand tracking.
Custom Score Limit: Choose points (5, 7, or 10) before the game starts.
Ball Speed Increase: Ball speeds up on paddle collision.
Game Over Display: Shows winner when score limit is reached.
Controls:
Hand Movement: Moves paddles up/down.
Ball Bounces: Off paddles and screen edges.
Score Increments: When the ball crosses either side.
Dependencies:
OpenCV: Captures hand movement.
MediaPipe: Tracks hands and detects positions.
Pygame: Renders the game.
Future Improvements:
Improve hand tracking for more precise movements.
Add sound effects and UI enhancements.
Multiplayer over the network.
